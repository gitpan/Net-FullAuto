#   WARNING:  THIS IS A ***BETA*** RELEASE OF Net::FullAuto
#
#   Net::FullAuto is powerful network process automation
#   software that has been in un-released development for
#   more than eleven years. For this reason, you may find
#   it to be useful for many process automation projects.
#   Because it has been worked on for so long, it may appear
#   to work well, and pass a number of non-intensive tests.
#
#   DO NOT - I REPEAT - DO !!NOT!! USE IN A PRODUCTION
#   ENVIRONMENT! This is newly released software that has
#   not had the benefit of wide exposure - and the presence
#   of here-to-now undetected bugs and design flaws is a
#   virtual certainty. DO NOT USE IN IN/FOR A PROCESS WHERE
#   DATA LOSS IS UNRECOVERABLE. DO NOT USE IN/FOR A PROCESS
#   WHERE DATA INTEGRITY IS CRITICAL. DO NOT USE IN/FOR A
#   PROCESS THAT IS TIME SENSITIVE, UNMONITORED, OR
#   PERSISTENCE CRITICAL. DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE WITHOUT
#   ANOTHER METHOD iOR RUNNING THE PROCESS YOU WISH TO
#   AUTOMATE WITH Net::FullAuto. DO NOT USE IN/FOR A PROCESS
#   WHERE FAILURE OF "ANY KIND" IS UNACCEPTABLE.

        * Much more work on "Scheduled Jobs" - can actually
          populate running cron job.


2011-02-07  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.9914 released.

        * Version 0.9912 released.

        * Removed 'use MLDBM' and 'use DB_File' from FullAuto.pm.
          This should fix full install.

        * Included Test::Deep (needed by MIME::Tools) and
          Term::RawInput in required modules list in
          Makefile.PL.

        * Fixed what "should" be the very last Cygwin
          "reliability" bug. When login process fails to verify
          /tmp dir, it fails the login quietly behind the scenes
          and re-attempts. Testing has so far been successful.

        * Completed coding for keeping passwords encrypted
          while in volatile memory as much as possible. The
          lifespan of clear text passwords in memory can now
          be measured in milliseconds.

        * Fixed some more runtime bugs that surfaced via
          'use strict'.
        

2011-02-06  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 101 also did not Index. So we'll try .991
          (I don't want to go 1.0 just yet).


2011-02-05  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.101 released.

        * CPAN Indexing of Version 100 failed (I'm *not*
          surprised). Going to version 101 "should" fix the
          issue.


2011-02-05  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.100 released.

        * Version 0.97 released.
      
        * Implemented new rotating encryption key logic, to
          make cleartext passwords and/or keys to encrypt
          them impossible to determine from looking at source
          code alone. Using String::Random for this feature.


2011-01-21  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.96 released.

        * Hundreds of changes to both Term::Menus and FullAuto.
          'use strict' and 'use warnings' are NOW TURNED *ON*
          in all files!

        * Version 0.92 released.

        * New "Plan" functionality is now implemented.


2011-01-04  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.91 released.

        * Fixed output when entire output returns in one
          string (happens mostly on AIX).

        * Changed 'kill' on Cygwin to use kill -f instead of
          kill -9 (which gets permission denied on Windows
          2008 Server).


2011-01-02  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.90 released.

        * Fixed last "known" error condition when running under

2010-12-29  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.87 released.

        * Removed all code utilizing MLDBM and DB_File and

          to connect. Timeout is used for when FullAuto runs in
          cron, or on a server by another process or service with
          no user interaction. The situation can be remedied by
          using the --authorize_connect argument when first
