          populate running cron job.


2011-02-07  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.9914 released.

        * Fixed what "should" be the very last Cygwin
          "reliability" bug. When login process fails to verify

          and re-attempts. Testing has so far been successful.

        * Completed coding for keeping passwords encrypted
          while in volatile memory as much as possible. The
          lifespan of clear text passwords in memory can now

          'use strict'.

2011-02-05  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.101 released.

        * CPAN Indexing of Version 100 failed (I'm *not*

          issue.

        * Version 0.97 released.
      
        * Implemented new rotating encryption key logic, to
          make cleartext passwords and/or keys to encrypt
          them impossible to determine from looking at source
          code alone. Using String::Random for this feature.


2011-01-21  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.96 released.

        * Hundreds of changes to both Term::Menus and FullAuto.
          'use strict' and 'use warnings' are NOW TURNED *ON*
          in all files!

          string (happens mostly on AIX).

        * Changed 'kill' on Cygwin to use kill -f instead of
          kill -9 (which gets permission denied on Windows
          2008 Server).


2011-01-02  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.90 released.
