        * Much more work on "Scheduled Jobs" - can actually
          populate running cron job.

        * Version 0.9913 released.

        * Regular Expression fix [$%>#-:] to [:$%>#-] because
          the former was improperly matching a '('.

        * Version 0.9912 released.

        * Removed 'use MLDBM' and 'use DB_File' from FullAuto.pm.

        * Included Test::Deep (needed by MIME::Tools) and

          "reliability" bug. When login process fails to verify

          and re-attempts. Testing has so far been successful.

        * Completed coding for keeping passwords encrypted
          while in volatile memory as much as possible. The
          lifespan of clear text passwords in memory can now

        * Version 0.101 released.

        * CPAN Indexing of Version 100 failed (I'm *not*

          issue.

        * Implemented new rotating encryption key logic, to
          make cleartext passwords and/or keys to encrypt
          them impossible to determine from looking at source
          code alone. Using String::Random for this feature.


2011-01-21  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.96 released.

        * Fixed output when entire output returns in one
          string (happens mostly on AIX).

        * Changed 'kill' on Cygwin to use kill -f instead of
          kill -9 (which gets permission denied on Windows
          2008 Server).


2011-01-02  Brian M. Kelly  <Brian.Kelly@fullautosoftware.com>

        * Version 0.90 released.

          to connect. Timeout is used for when FullAuto runs in
          cron, or on a server by another process or service with
          no user interaction. The situation can be remedied by
          using the --authorize_connect argument when first
